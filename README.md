Project for a website.

Next idea - website for displaying the entance-display
  > use raspberry for the entrance communicator; take old laptop/monitor screen and
   connect it to the raspberry; top half is video from entrance when doorbell is rung,
   bottom half is weather information and maybe daily/weekly calendar
